# Clip Across VM

## Introduction

This is a simple tool for copy from Windows host system to Linux virtual system using socket.

I made this because the vm-tool of the VMWare Player is just not working properly.

## Usage

I think it's so simple a project that all of you could get started in a glance.

> Noting that the Win32 implementation is not to be completed. I just leave it here for reference, if someone needs that.
>
> It contains a simple example of watching Windows clipboard using Win32 API and an example of sending some data with Winsock2

If you understand Chinese, you might as well read the development notes made through my working on this project. ^_^
